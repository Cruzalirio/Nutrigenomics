##  Overview

This chapter introduces nutrigenomics from a **statistical perspective**, motivates key **experimental designs**, and reviews the **types of data** used in this field. It concludes with practical guidance for setting up R and the course repository.

###  What is Nutrigenomics (Statistical View)

Nutrigenomics explores how dietary patterns influence gene expression, epigenetic marks, and metabolic outcomes. Statistically, we ask:

- Which molecular features are associated with nutrient intake or dietary interventions?  
- How to separate real signals from high-dimensional noise (multiple testing, regularization, FDR)?  
- How to model complex designs and account for confounding or batch effects?  
- How to quantify uncertainty and reproducibility?

**Main challenges:** high dimensionality (p≫n), correlated predictors, measurement error in diet data, and causal inference vs. association.

###  Why Design Matters

Design choice determines causal interpretability and power.

- **Case–control (retrospective):** efficient for rare outcomes, common in gene–diet interaction studies.  
  *Example:* Hoang et al., *JAMA Network Open* (2024). DOI: [10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0465](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0465)

- **Cross-sectional:** exposure and outcome measured simultaneously, used for exploratory omics–diet associations.  
  *Example:* Do et al., *Int J Epidemiol.* (2021). DOI: [10.1093/ije/dyaa215](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa215)

- **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):** causal inference via randomization; typical for genotype‑based dietary advice.  
  *Example:* Horne et al., *BMC Public Health* (2019). DOI: [10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8)

**Note:** Randomization removes confounding in expectation; observational designs require covariate adjustment and sensitivity analyses.

### Statistical View of Each Design

| **Design** | **Typical Model** | **Key Statistical Notes** |
|:--|:--|:--|
| Case–control | Conditional logistic regression | Adjust for matching and population structure |
| Cross-sectional | Linear model or GLM | Control FDR in omics scans |
| Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) | Mixed models or ANCOVA | Power analysis, ITT (intention-to-treat) principle |
| Cohort study | Cox proportional hazards or mixed models | Handle time-to-event data; control for confounding |
| Case series | Descriptive or exploratory modeling | Limited inferential power; often hypothesis-generating |
| Survey | Weighted regression or complex survey design models | Incorporate sampling weights and stratification |
| Meta-analysis | Random- or fixed-effects models | Assess heterogeneity ($I^2$); potential publication bias |
| Systematic review | Narrative synthesis or meta-analytic framework | Transparent inclusion criteria; quality assessment essential |

### Types of Data in Nutrigenomics

1. **Omics data** (gene expression, methylation, metabolomics)  
   - Example: EWAS of diet quality — DOI: [10.1093/ije/dyaa215](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa215)
2. **Clinical data** (anthropometry, blood lipids, disease outcomes)  
   - Example: NOW Trial — DOI: [10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8)
3. **Dietary data** (FFQs, 24h recalls, dietary indices)  
   - Example: Zheng et al., *PLOS ONE* (2020). DOI: [10.1371/journal.pone.0230669](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230669)

Each has unique preprocessing and error structures (e.g., normalization for omics, energy adjustment for dietary data).

##  First R Session for Beginners

This section introduces R to students with no prior experience.

###  Software Installation

- Install **R**: <https://cran.r-project.org>  
- Install **RStudio (Posit Desktop)**: <https://posit.co/desktop>

---

###  Class Repository Setup

1. Visit the course GitHub repository:  
   `https://Cruzalirio.github.io/Nutrigenomics` (placeholder URL)
2. Open the folder in RStudio.

The repository will include:

```
/data/          → datasets
/scripts/       → R scripts for each class
/assignments/   → homework templates
```

---

### Basic R Commands

```r
# Install packages
install.packages("tidyverse")

# Load libraries
library(tidyverse)

# Read a CSV file
d <- read_csv("data/diet_gene_example.csv")

# Inspect structure
glimpse(d)

# Quick summary
d %>% group_by(case_status) %>% summarize(mean_BMI = mean(BMI, na.rm = TRUE), n = n())
```

### Exercise
Run each line, explain what it does, and identify one potential data quality issue (missing values, unrealistic ranges, etc.).

##  Homework Assignment 1

**Objective:** Ensure students can run R code and submit outputs.

**Tasks:**
1. Install R and RStudio.  
2. Download or clone the GitHub repository.  
3. Run the script `scripts/01_read_and_inspect.R`.  
4. Save a screenshot of your R console with the output of `glimpse()` and `summary()`.
5. Write a short note (4–6 sentences) describing the dataset, one variable of interest, and one issue you observed.

**Submission:** Upload both files to the repository folder `submissions/`.
