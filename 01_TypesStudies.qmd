## Overview

This chapter introduces nutrigenomics from a **statistical perspective**, motivates key **experimental designs**, and reviews the **types of data** used in this field. It concludes with practical guidance for setting up R and the course repository.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### What is Nutrigenomics (Statistical View)

Nutrigenomics explores how dietary patterns influence gene expression, epigenetic marks, and metabolic outcomes. Statistically, we ask:

-   Which molecular features are associated with nutrient intake or dietary interventions?\
-   How to separate real signals from high-dimensional noise (multiple testing, regularization, FDR)?\
-   How to model complex designs and account for confounding or batch effects?\
-   How to quantify uncertainty and reproducibility?

**Main challenges:** high dimensionality (p≫n), correlated predictors, measurement error in diet data, and causal inference vs. association.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Basic Concepts

### Clinical Study

A clinical study is a process whose objective is to obtain empirical evidence on a specific issue. In the case of the studies we are dealing with in this course, this issue is, naturally, about some aspect of nutrigenomics.

### Unit of Observation

In a statistical study, the unit of observation is, for the sake of clarity, the type of what or who is being measured during the research. In medical studies, these are typically people, but not always. For example, they can be events that happen to people, so that the same person can be observed multiple times: pregnancies, surgical operations. For example, we can measure the average daily expenditure on processed food vending machines in different primary schools in a city and the proportion of myopic students in their schools, to estimate whether there is any relationship between processed food consumption and myopia. Here, the unit of observation is the primary schools, not the students.

### Population and Sample

- **Population**: This is the set of all observation units about which we want to know some information. This population can be perfectly defined in a place and time: for example, those registered in Mallorca today. But its definition will usually be vague. If, for example, we want to estimate something about "diabetic Spaniards over 65 years of age," who exactly are we talking about? Those who are alive right now? All those who have been in Spain since its founding? Do we include those who have not yet been born? What do we do with those who are diabetic but have not been diagnosed, and never will be?

- **Sample**: This is a subset of the population that has been selected for observation. The idea is for the sample to be representative of the population, so that the results obtained from the sample can be generalized to the population. In the previous example, we could select a sample of diabetic Spaniards over the age of 65, and from this sample, attempt to estimate some characteristic of the diabetic population of Spaniards over the age of 65.

### Types of Statistics

In statistics, we always start by obtaining **data** on a sample of a population. Well, actually, we don't start by obtaining the data, but by carefully planning how to obtain it.

We **generalize the information** obtained about this group of people to the entire population.
And this isn't just a case of fortune-telling magic tricks, but a **science** whose methodology has been validated through mathematical demonstrations or, in the worst case, through numerical simulations (the mathematical equivalent of experiments in other sciences).

Thus, the starting point when applying statistical techniques is that we have a set of data that describe some characteristics of a group of individuals. Statistical analysis of these data can then be of two basic types:

- **Exploratory data analysis**, when our objective is simply to summarize, represent, and explain the specific data available. **Descriptive statistics** is the set of techniques used for this purpose.

- **Inferential analysis**, if our objective is to deduce (**infer**) from these data, significant information about the entire population of interest. The techniques used in this case comprise **inferential statistics**.

----------------------------------

### Why Design Matters

Design choice determines causal interpretability and power.

-   **Case–control (retrospective):** efficient for rare outcomes, common in gene–diet interaction studies.\
    *Example:* Hoang et al., *JAMA Network Open* (2024). DOI: [10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0465](https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0465)

-   **Cross-sectional:** exposure and outcome measured simultaneously, used for exploratory omics–diet associations.\
    *Example:* Do et al., *Int J Epidemiol.* (2021). DOI: [10.1093/ije/dyaa215](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa215)

-   **Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT):** causal inference via randomization; typical for genotype‑based dietary advice.\
    *Example:* Horne et al., *BMC Public Health* (2019). DOI: [10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8)

**Note:** Randomization removes confounding in expectation; observational designs require covariate adjustment and sensitivity analyses.

## Design Types

#### Descriptive Studies

* **Case Report**: A detailed description of a patient.

* **Case Series**: A detailed description of a small group of people with a common health problem. Information is usually collected through medical histories and clinical interviews.

* **Survey**: A description of a large group of individuals with a common characteristic. Information is usually collected through questionnaires or interviews. These studies are used to identify interesting observations worthy of investigation.

#### Case-Control Studies

* A group of individuals with the disease (cases) and a group of individuals without the disease (controls) are taken.

* They are compared retrospectively to find differences in their past exposure to risk factors.

* It is determined which risk factors were more common among cases than among controls.

* It is inferred that, in the general population, exposure to these factors is associated with a higher likelihood of suffering from the disease.

**Case-control samples**

* **Stratified sample**: A sample made up of predetermined numbers of cases and controls. If the sample is stratified and *artificially composed*, we do not expect the proportion of cases in the sample to be representative of the population.

* **Cross-sectional samples**: A sample with no restrictions on its composition, "whatever comes out." If the sample is cross-sectional, we expect the proportion of cases in the sample to be representative of the population.
**Advantages of case-control samples**:

* The survey suffers from a **lack of denominators**: a control group with which to compare the cases.

* Relatively easy and quick to carry out, and therefore inexpensive.

* Suitable for studying rare, infrequent, or very short-term diseases.

* They allow for studying the association between exposure to many risk factors and the disease in question.

**Problems: Biases**

**Biases**: Errors in the design or execution of a study that affect the data collected and may jeopardize the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from data collection through interviews/questionnaires.

* **Recall bias**: Everyone lies. Forgetfulness.

* **Differential recall bias**: Cases and controls may recall relevant data differently.

* **Survivorship bias**: Only "living" individuals are studied.

**Problems: Representativeness**

To conclude that there is an association between exposure and disease, it would be necessary that:

* Controls were similar to cases in all aspects except exposure.

* Matching: Select controls who are similar to cases in all relevant characteristics.

* Controls were representative of the healthy population.
**Problems: Confounders**

* **Confounder**: A characteristic associated with exposure that can cause disease. Disease

**Problems: Lack of Causality**

A case-control study cannot "prove" that exposure to a risk "causes" a disease.

In reality: <p style="color: red;">No type of medical study can demonstrate with absolute certainty that exposure to a risk causes a disease.</p>

#### Cohort Studies

* A group of individuals are **exposed** to a risk factor and a group of individuals **not exposed** to the same risk factor.
* A group of individuals are **exposed** to a risk factor and a group of individuals **not exposed** to the same risk factor.

* They are followed over a period of time to **prospectively** compare the occurrence of a disease in both groups.

* A study is made to determine whether the disease is more common among those exposed than among those not exposed.

* If so, it can be inferred that, in the general population, exposure to the risk factor is associated with a higher likelihood of suffering from the disease.

* The objective is to study the onset of the disease after exposure: The cohort must be composed of individuals without the disease at the time of follow-up.

**Prospective versus Retrospective Cohort Studies**

<p style="color: red;"> Prospective </p>: Exposed and unexposed individuals are taken today, and their future outcomes are studied.

<p style="color: red;"> Retrospective </p>: Exposed and unexposed individuals are taken at a certain point in the past, and their outcomes to the present are studied.

#### Cross-sectional studies

In cross-sectional studies, both the disease and potential influencing factors (or other characteristics) are observed simultaneously in a cross-sectional sample of individuals — that is, without a before-and-after component.

::: {.callout-note}
For a study to be considered cross-sectional, it must meet the following criteria:

* **Cross-sectional in time**: The information refers to a single point in time, or at least the passage of time is not relevant to the study.

* **Cross-sectional sample**: The sample is not pre-stratified by the characteristics under study or by variables related to them (i.e., not stratified sampling).
:::

#### Ecological studies

In ecological studies, the variables of interest are measured at the **group level** (countries, cities, neighborhoods), not at the individual level.  
The occurrence of a disease is compared across groups with different levels of exposure.

::: {.callout-note}
**Beware of the ecological fallacy:**

* From an ecological study, nothing can be inferred at the individual level.  
* For example, we cannot conclude that *individuals* who eat red meat have a higher risk of colon cancer — it may be that the cases of colon cancer occurred among those who did **not** eat red meat.
:::

#### Interventional studies

* **Clinical trial**: Interventional medical study involving humans.

* **Randomized clinical trial (RCT)**: Clinical trial in which individuals are randomly assigned to two or more groups receiving different treatments, and the outcomes are compared. Usually, one group serves as the control group.

* **Controlled clinical trial**: Clinical trial comparing a group that receives a treatment with another that does not receive it.

* **Experimental study**: Any other type of interventional study.

---

#### Classification by blinding

* **Open-label**: Both participants and evaluators know which treatment each participant receives.

* **Single-blind**: Either the participants or the evaluators do not know which treatment each participant receives.

* **Double-blind**: Neither participants nor evaluators know which treatment each participant receives.

* **Triple-blind**: Participants, evaluators, and data analysts all remain unaware of the treatment allocation.

---

#### Placebo

A placebo is a substance identical in appearance to the active treatment but **pharmacologically inactive**. It can be used for:

* **Blinding the trial**: The control group receives something inert rather than nothing at all.
* **Assessing the placebo effect**: Change in the patient’s response simply due to receiving treatment.
* **Estimating the spontaneous recovery rate**: The proportion of patients who recover without any active treatment.

---

#### Classification by group formation

* **Parallel-group study**: Different groups of subjects are assigned to receive different treatments.

* **Crossover study**: Each subject receives multiple treatments at different times in a randomized order — each participant serves as their own control.

---

#### Meta-analysis

* **Systematic review**: A summary of all published research addressing a specific question. Patients are not studied directly — only previously published clinical studies.

* **Meta-analysis**: A systematic review that uses **statistical techniques** to quantitatively combine results from previous studies.

> **Meta-analysis**: A systematic review that uses statistical techniques to jointly analyze published results.

### Statistical View of Each Design

| **Design** | **Description** | **Typical Model** | **Key Statistical Notes** |
|:---------------|:-------------------------|:---------------|:---------------|
| **Case series** | Descriptive report of a group of individuals with a shared exposure, treatment, or outcome, without a control group. | Descriptive or exploratory modeling | Limited inferential power; often used for hypothesis generation. |
| **Survey** | Cross-sectional collection of information from a sample representing a population at one point in time. | Weighted regression or complex survey design models | Incorporate sampling weights and stratification; correct for design effects. |
| **Cohort study** | Observational design following participants over time to assess associations between exposures and outcomes. | Cox proportional hazards or mixed models | Handle time-to-event data; control for confounding and censoring. |
| **Case–control study** | Observational design comparing subjects with an outcome (cases) to those without (controls). | Conditional logistic regression | Adjust for matching, population structure, and selection bias. |
| **Quasi-experimental study** | Design with an intervention but lacking random assignment, often using pre/post or matched control comparisons. | Difference-in-differences, interrupted time series | Control for confounding and temporal trends; weaker causal inference. |
| **Experimental (RCT)** | Randomized Controlled Trial assigning subjects randomly to treatments to infer causal effects. | Mixed models or ANCOVA | Power analysis, ITT (intention-to-treat) principle; high internal validity. |
| **Meta-analysis** | Statistical synthesis of results from multiple independent studies addressing the same question. | Random- or fixed-effects models | Assess heterogeneity ($I^2$); evaluate publication bias. |
| **Systematic review** | Structured, transparent literature review following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. | Narrative synthesis or meta-analytic framework | Ensures reproducibility and quality assessment of included studies. |

### Types of Data in Nutrigenomics

1.  **Omics data** (gene expression, methylation, metabolomics)
    -   Example: EWAS of diet quality — DOI: [10.1093/ije/dyaa215](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyaa215)
2.  **Clinical data** (anthropometry, blood lipids, disease outcomes)
    -   Example: NOW Trial — DOI: [10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8)
3.  **Dietary data** (FFQs, 24h recalls, dietary indices)
    -   Example: Zheng et al., *PLOS ONE* (2020). DOI: [10.1371/journal.pone.0230669](https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0230669)

Each has unique preprocessing and error structures (e.g., normalization for omics, energy adjustment for dietary data).
