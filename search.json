    "section": "2.1 Basic Concepts",
    "text": "2.1 Basic Concepts\n\n2.1.1 Clinical Study\nA clinical study is a process whose objective is to obtain empirical evidence on a specific issue. In the case of the studies we are dealing with in this course, this issue is, naturally, about some aspect of nutrigenomics.\n\n\n2.1.2 Unit of Observation\nIn a statistical study, the unit of observation is, for the sake of clarity, the type of what or who is being measured during the research. In medical studies, these are typically people, but not always. For example, they can be events that happen to people, so that the same person can be observed multiple times: pregnancies, surgical operations. For example, we can measure the average daily expenditure on processed food vending machines in different primary schools in a city and the proportion of myopic students in their schools, to estimate whether there is any relationship between processed food consumption and myopia. Here, the unit of observation is the primary schools, not the students.\n\n\n2.1.3 Population and Sample\n\nPopulation: This is the set of all observation units about which we want to know some information. This population can be perfectly defined in a place and time: for example, those registered in Mallorca today. But its definition will usually be vague. If, for example, we want to estimate something about “diabetic Spaniards over 65 years of age,” who exactly are we talking about? Those who are alive right now? All those who have been in Spain since its founding? Do we include those who have not yet been born? What do we do with those who are diabetic but have not been diagnosed, and never will be?\nSample: This is a subset of the population that has been selected for observation. The idea is for the sample to be representative of the population, so that the results obtained from the sample can be generalized to the population. In the previous example, we could select a sample of diabetic Spaniards over the age of 65, and from this sample, attempt to estimate some characteristic of the diabetic population of Spaniards over the age of 65.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Types of Statistics\nIn statistics, we always start by obtaining data on a sample of a population. Well, actually, we don’t start by obtaining the data, but by carefully planning how to obtain it.\nWe generalize the information obtained about this group of people to the entire population. And this isn’t just a case of fortune-telling magic tricks, but a science whose methodology has been validated through mathematical demonstrations or, in the worst case, through numerical simulations (the mathematical equivalent of experiments in other sciences).\nThus, the starting point when applying statistical techniques is that we have a set of data that describe some characteristics of a group of individuals. Statistical analysis of these data can then be of two basic types:\n\nExploratory data analysis, when our objective is simply to summarize, represent, and explain the specific data available. Descriptive statistics is the set of techniques used for this purpose.\nInferential analysis, if our objective is to deduce (infer) from these data, significant information about the entire population of interest. The techniques used in this case comprise inferential statistics.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Why Design Matters\nDesign choice determines causal interpretability and power.\n\nCase–control (retrospective): efficient for rare outcomes, common in gene–diet interaction studies.\nExample: Hoang et al., JAMA Network Open (2024). DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0465\nCross-sectional: exposure and outcome measured simultaneously, used for exploratory omics–diet associations.\nExample: Do et al., Int J Epidemiol. (2021). DOI: 10.1093/ije/dyaa215\nRandomized Controlled Trial (RCT): causal inference via randomization; typical for genotype‑based dietary advice.\nExample: Horne et al., BMC Public Health (2019). DOI: 10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8\n\nNote: Randomization removes confounding in expectation; observational designs require covariate adjustment and sensitivity analyses.",

    "text": "2.2 Design Types\n\n2.2.0.1 Descriptive Studies\n\nCase Report: A detailed description of a patient.\nCase Series: A detailed description of a small group of people with a common health problem. Information is usually collected through medical histories and clinical interviews.\nSurvey: A description of a large group of individuals with a common characteristic. Information is usually collected through questionnaires or interviews. These studies are used to identify interesting observations worthy of investigation.\n\n\n\n2.2.0.2 Case-Control Studies\n\nA group of individuals with the disease (cases) and a group of individuals without the disease (controls) are taken.\nThey are compared retrospectively to find differences in their past exposure to risk factors.\nIt is determined which risk factors were more common among cases than among controls.\nIt is inferred that, in the general population, exposure to these factors is associated with a higher likelihood of suffering from the disease.\n\nCase-control samples\n\nStratified sample: A sample made up of predetermined numbers of cases and controls. If the sample is stratified and artificially composed, we do not expect the proportion of cases in the sample to be representative of the population.\nCross-sectional samples: A sample with no restrictions on its composition, “whatever comes out.” If the sample is cross-sectional, we expect the proportion of cases in the sample to be representative of the population. Advantages of case-control samples:\nThe survey suffers from a lack of denominators: a control group with which to compare the cases.\nRelatively easy and quick to carry out, and therefore inexpensive.\nSuitable for studying rare, infrequent, or very short-term diseases.\nThey allow for studying the association between exposure to many risk factors and the disease in question.\n\nProblems: Biases\nBiases: Errors in the design or execution of a study that affect the data collected and may jeopardize the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from data collection through interviews/questionnaires.\n\nRecall bias: Everyone lies. Forgetfulness.\nDifferential recall bias: Cases and controls may recall relevant data differently.\nSurvivorship bias: Only “living” individuals are studied.\n\nProblems: Representativeness\nTo conclude that there is an association between exposure and disease, it would be necessary that:\n\nControls were similar to cases in all aspects except exposure.\nMatching: Select controls who are similar to cases in all relevant characteristics.\nControls were representative of the healthy population. Problems: Confounders\nConfounder: A characteristic associated with exposure that can cause disease. Disease\n\nProblems: Lack of Causality\nA case-control study cannot “prove” that exposure to a risk “causes” a disease.\nIn reality:\n\nNo type of medical study can demonstrate with absolute certainty that exposure to a risk causes a disease.\n\n\n\n2.2.0.3 Cohort Studies\n\nA group of individuals are exposed to a risk factor and a group of individuals not exposed to the same risk factor.\nA group of individuals are exposed to a risk factor and a group of individuals not exposed to the same risk factor.\nThey are followed over a period of time to prospectively compare the occurrence of a disease in both groups.\nA study is made to determine whether the disease is more common among those exposed than among those not exposed.\nIf so, it can be inferred that, in the general population, exposure to the risk factor is associated with a higher likelihood of suffering from the disease.\nThe objective is to study the onset of the disease after exposure: The cohort must be composed of individuals without the disease at the time of follow-up.\n\nProspective versus Retrospective Cohort Studies\n\nProspective\n\n: Exposed and unexposed individuals are taken today, and their future outcomes are studied.\n\nRetrospective\n\n: Exposed and unexposed individuals are taken at a certain point in the past, and their outcomes to the present are studied.\n\n\n2.2.0.4 Cross-sectional studies\nIn cross-sectional studies, both the disease and potential influencing factors (or other characteristics) are observed simultaneously in a cross-sectional sample of individuals — that is, without a before-and-after component.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota\n\n\n\nFor a study to be considered cross-sectional, it must meet the following criteria:\n\nCross-sectional in time: The information refers to a single point in time, or at least the passage of time is not relevant to the study.\nCross-sectional sample: The sample is not pre-stratified by the characteristics under study or by variables related to them (i.e., not stratified sampling).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.5 Ecological studies\nIn ecological studies, the variables of interest are measured at the group level (countries, cities, neighborhoods), not at the individual level.\nThe occurrence of a disease is compared across groups with different levels of exposure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNota\n\n\n\nBeware of the ecological fallacy:\n\nFrom an ecological study, nothing can be inferred at the individual level.\n\nFor example, we cannot conclude that individuals who eat red meat have a higher risk of colon cancer — it may be that the cases of colon cancer occurred among those who did not eat red meat.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.6 Interventional studies\n\nClinical trial: Interventional medical study involving humans.\nRandomized clinical trial (RCT): Clinical trial in which individuals are randomly assigned to two or more groups receiving different treatments, and the outcomes are compared. Usually, one group serves as the control group.\nControlled clinical trial: Clinical trial comparing a group that receives a treatment with another that does not receive it.\nExperimental study: Any other type of interventional study.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.7 Classification by blinding\n\nOpen-label: Both participants and evaluators know which treatment each participant receives.\nSingle-blind: Either the participants or the evaluators do not know which treatment each participant receives.\nDouble-blind: Neither participants nor evaluators know which treatment each participant receives.\nTriple-blind: Participants, evaluators, and data analysts all remain unaware of the treatment allocation.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.8 Placebo\nA placebo is a substance identical in appearance to the active treatment but pharmacologically inactive. It can be used for:\n\nBlinding the trial: The control group receives something inert rather than nothing at all.\nAssessing the placebo effect: Change in the patient’s response simply due to receiving treatment.\nEstimating the spontaneous recovery rate: The proportion of patients who recover without any active treatment.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.9 Classification by group formation\n\nParallel-group study: Different groups of subjects are assigned to receive different treatments.\nCrossover study: Each subject receives multiple treatments at different times in a randomized order — each participant serves as their own control.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.10 Meta-analysis\n\nSystematic review: A summary of all published research addressing a specific question. Patients are not studied directly — only previously published clinical studies.\nMeta-analysis: A systematic review that uses statistical techniques to quantitatively combine results from previous studies.\n\n\nMeta-analysis: A systematic review that uses statistical techniques to jointly analyze published results.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.0.11 Pyramid of evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.1 Statistical View of Each Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nDescription\nTypical Model\nKey Statistical Notes\n\n\n\n\nCase series\nDescriptive report of a group of individuals with a shared exposure, treatment, or outcome, without a control group.\nDescriptive or exploratory modeling\nLimited inferential power; often used for hypothesis generation.\n\n\nSurvey\nCross-sectional collection of information from a sample representing a population at one point in time.\nWeighted regression or complex survey design models\nIncorporate sampling weights and stratification; correct for design effects.\n\n\nCohort study\nObservational design following participants over time to assess associations between exposures and outcomes.\nCox proportional hazards or mixed models\nHandle time-to-event data; control for confounding and censoring.\n\n\nCase–control study\nObservational design comparing subjects with an outcome (cases) to those without (controls).\nConditional logistic regression\nAdjust for matching, population structure, and selection bias.\n\n\nQuasi-experimental study\nDesign with an intervention but lacking random assignment, often using pre/post or matched control comparisons.\nDifference-in-differences, interrupted time series\nControl for confounding and temporal trends; weaker causal inference.\n\n\nExperimental (RCT)\nRandomized Controlled Trial assigning subjects randomly to treatments to infer causal effects.\nMixed models or ANCOVA\nPower analysis, ITT (intention-to-treat) principle; high internal validity.\n\n\nMeta-analysis\nStatistical synthesis of results from multiple independent studies addressing the same question.\nRandom- or fixed-effects models\nAssess heterogeneity (\\(I^2\\)); evaluate publication bias.\n\n\nSystematic review\nStructured, transparent literature review following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nNarrative synthesis or meta-analytic framework\nEnsures reproducibility and quality assessment of included studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Types of Data in Nutrigenomics\n\nOmics data (gene expression, methylation, metabolomics)\n\nExample: EWAS of diet quality — DOI: 10.1093/ije/dyaa215\n\nClinical data (anthropometry, blood lipids, disease outcomes)\n\nExample: NOW Trial — DOI: 10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8\n\nDietary data (FFQs, 24h recalls, dietary indices)\n\nExample: Zheng et al., PLOS ONE (2020). DOI: 10.1371/journal.pone.0230669\n\n\nEach has unique preprocessing and error structures (e.g., normalization for omics, energy adjustment for dietary data).",

Each year, the survey collects responses from over 400,000 Americans about health risk behaviors, chronic health conditions, and preventive service use. It has been conducted annually since 1984. For this project, we used a CSV file from the dataset available on Kaggle for the year 2015.\nThe diabetes_BRFSS2015.csv dataset contains 253,680 cleaned responses from the 2015 BRFSS survey. The target variable Diabetes_012 has 3 classes: 0 = no diabetes or only during pregnancy, 1 = prediabetes, 2 = diabetes. The dataset has class imbalance and 21 feature variables.\nVariable descriptions:\n\n\nDiabetes_012: 0 = no diabetes, 1 = prediabetes, 2 = diabetes\nHighBP: 0 = no high BP, 1 = high BP\nHighChol: 0 = no high cholesterol, 1 = high cholesterol\nCholCheck: 0 = no cholesterol check in 5 years, 1 = yes\nBMI: Body Mass Index\nSmoker: Have you smoked at least 100 cigarettes in your lifetime? 0 = no, 1 = yes\nStroke: Ever told you had a stroke? 0 = no, 1 = yes\nHeartDiseaseorAttack: Coronary heart disease (CHD) or myocardial infarction (MI) 0 = no, 1 = yes\nPhysActivity: Physical activity in past 30 days (excluding job) 0 = no, 1 = yes\nFruits: Consume fruit once or more per day 0 = no, 1 = yes\nVeggies: Consume vegetables once or more per day 0 = no, 1 = yes\nHvyAlcoholConsump: Heavy drinkers (adult men &gt;14 drinks/week, adult women &gt;7 drinks/week) 0 = no, 1 = yes\nAnyHealthcare: Have any health care coverage? 0 = no, 1 = yes\nNoDocbcCost: Could not see a doctor due to cost in the past 12 months? 0 = no, 1 = yes\nGenHlth: General health self-assessment scale 1-5 (1 = excellent, 5 = poor)\nMentHlth: Days in past 30 days mental health was not good (stress, depression, emotions) 1-30\nPhysHlth: Days in past 30 days physical health was not good 1-30\nDiffWalk: Serious difficulty walking or climbing stairs? 0 = no, 1 = yes\nSex: 0 = female, 1 = male\nAge: 13-level age category (_AGEG5YR) 1 = 18-24, 13 = 80+\nEducation: Education level (EDUCA) scale 1-6 (1 = never attended school, 6 = college graduate)\nIncome: Income scale (INCOME2) 1 = &lt;$10,000, 8 = $75,000 or more\n\n\n3.3.1 Exercise 1\n\nHow would you classify each of the variables above?\nSome variables were transformed during measurement. How would you classify them if they were not transformed?\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Exercise 2\nReview this questionnaire\n\nClassify each variable.\nWhich variables do not fit in the four categories (nominal, ordinal, interval, ratio)?\nAre any of these questions sensitive?\nAre any questions unclear to the target population?\nWhat issues could arise when applying it?\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Working with R\nLibraries needed for loading, manipulating, and visualizing data:\n\nreadxl: readxl is a package designed for a single task: importing Excel sheets into R. It is lightweight and efficient but does not have advanced functions. It works on Windows, Linux, and OSX, and supports Excel 97-03 (.xls) and newer versions (.xlsx). Formulas in cells are imported as their results. The goal of using readxl is to have tidy data, where each row is an observation and each column is a variable — ideal for statistical analysis.\nTidyverse: A data ecosystem in R, consisting of several packages:\n\ndplyr: A grammar of data manipulation providing verbs to solve common data tasks:\n\nmutate() adds new variables as functions of existing ones\nselect() selects variables by name\nfilter() selects cases based on values\nsummarise() reduces multiple values to a summary\narrange() reorders rows\n\nggplot2: A system for declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics.\nreadr: Provides a fast way to read rectangular data from CSV or TSV files and reports parsing issues clearly.\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Installing Tidyverse\nAfter installing, load it with the command:\n\nlibrary(tidyverse)\n\nWarning: package 'ggplot2' was built under R version 4.5.2\n\n\n── Attaching core tidyverse packages ──────────────────────── tidyverse 2.0.0 ──\n✔ dplyr     1.1.4     ✔ readr     2.1.5\n✔ forcats   1.0.0     ✔ stringr   1.5.1\n✔ ggplot2   4.0.1     ✔ tibble    3.3.0\n✔ lubridate 1.9.4     ✔ tidyr     1.3.1\n✔ purrr     1.0.4     \n── Conflicts ────────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse_conflicts() ──\n✖ dplyr::filter() masks stats::filter()\n✖ dplyr::lag()    masks stats::lag()\nℹ Use the conflicted package (&lt;http://conflicted.r-lib.org/&gt;) to force all conflicts to become errors\n\n\n\ndatos = read_csv(\"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Cruzalirio/Unal-Enfermeria-/main/Datos/diabetes_BRFSS2015.csv\")\n\nRows: 253680 Columns: 32\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (32): Diabetes_012, HighBP, HighChol, CholCheck, BMI, Smoker, Stroke, He...\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n### La función head me permite ver las primeras filas\nhead(datos)\n\n# A tibble: 6 × 32\n  Diabetes_012 HighBP HighChol CholCheck   BMI Smoker Stroke\n         &lt;dbl&gt;

    "section": "",
    "text": "The probability of an event is, basically, a number between 0 and 1 (or, if you prefer, a percentage between 0% and 100%) that measures the expectation of that event occurring.\nIn this course, we will define the probability of an event as the proportion (the fraction, the percentage) of subjects in a population (or sometimes a sample, depending on the context) in whom the event occurs. This proportion measures the “probability” that if we randomly select a subject from the population, the event will occur.\nExample:\n\nThe probability that a coin toss lands on heads is the proportion of the population of tosses that land on heads.\n\nIn VERY simple cases, when all possible outcomes have the same probability, this proportion coincides with the fraction of times this event occurs in the set of possible outcomes and can therefore be calculated using the famous Laplace’s rule: \\[\n\\text{Probability}=\\frac{\\text{Favorable cases}}{\\text{Possible cases}}\n\\]\nFor example:\n\nThe probability of landing heads when tossing a balanced coin is 1/2 (favorable cases, 1; possible cases, 2; both outcomes have the same probability by definition of a balanced coin).\nHowever, the probability of a child being male is not 1/2, even though there are only two chromosomal sexes. It is the proportion of male children in the total number of all children, which is estimated to be around 51.22%.\nOr more exaggeratedly, the probability that a woman between the ages of 17 and 27 is myopic is not 1/2, even though there are only two possible outcomes: being myopic or not. This probability is the proportion of myopic individuals in the population made up of all women in that age group, which, in Spain in 2018, was estimated at 65.4% according to a report by the Visión y Vida Association.\n\n\n4.0.1 Set Algebra\nLet’s very quickly review the notations and properties of set operations, so we can use this language in what follows.\nLet \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) be subsets (in the context of probability theory, they are called events) of a set \\(\\Omega\\) (our population or, in the language of probability theory, the sample space).\n\n\\(A\\cup B\\) is the union of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): the set consisting of the elements of \\(\\Omega\\) that belong to \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) (or both).\n\\(A \\cap B\\) is the intersection of \\(A\\) and \\(B\\): the set consisting of the elements that simultaneously belong to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\).\n\nThis corresponds to the conjunction of natural language.\n\n\\(A^c\\) is the complementary of \\(A\\): the set consisting of the elements of \\(\\Omega\\) that do not belong to \\(A\\).\n\nThis corresponds to the negation of natural language.\n\n\\(A-B=A \\cap B^c\\) is the difference “\\(A\\) minus \\(B\\)”: the set formed by the elements of \\(A\\) that do not belong to \\(B\\).\n\nTherefore, \\(A^c=\\Omega-A\\).\n\nWe will say that \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are disjoint, or incompatible, when \\(A\\cap B=\\emptyset\\), where \\(\\emptyset\\) is the empty set, the set that has no elements.\nWe will say that \\(A\\) is contained, or included, in \\(B\\), and we will denote it by \\(A\\subseteq B\\), when every element of \\(A\\) belongs to \\(B\\). To emphasize that \\(A\\) is strictly contained in \\(B\\) (that it is contained in \\(B\\) but is not equal to \\(B\\)), we will use \\(A\\subsetneq B\\).\n\nExample:\n\nConsider the population \\(\\Omega\\) consisting of the students in a class, and let \\(A\\) be the subset consisting of the females in that class and \\(B\\) be the subset consisting of the students in that class who wear glasses.\n\n\\(A\\cup B\\) is the set consisting of the females in the class or the males in the class who wear glasses (or both).\n\\(A \\cap B\\) is the set consisting of the females in the class who wear glasses.\n\\(A^c\\) is the set consisting of the males in the class.\n\\(A-B\\) is the set consisting of the females in the class who do not wear glasses.\n\\(A\\subseteq B\\) means that all the females in the class wear glasses.\n\n\n\n\n4.0.2 Some basic formulas\nWe have defined the probability \\(P(A)\\) of a subset (event) \\(A\\) of a population (sample space) \\(\\Omega\\) as the fraction of the subjects in \\(\\Omega\\) that belong to \\(A\\). From this definition, the following properties follow:\n\nFor every event \\(A\\), \\(0\\leqslant P(A)\\leqslant 1\\).\n\nA subset \\(A\\) of \\(\\Omega\\) cannot represent either a negative fraction or a fraction greater than 1 of the subjects in \\(\\Omega\\).\n\n\\(P(\\Omega)=1\\) and \\(P(\\emptyset)=0\\) (remember that \\(\\emptyset\\) is the empty set).\nIf \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) are two disjoint events, then Thus, \\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)\\).\n\nIf no subject belongs simultaneously to both \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), then the number of subjects belonging to \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is the sum of those belonging to \\(A\\) and those belonging to \\(B\\). Then, dividing by the total number of individuals in the population \\(\\Omega\\) (its cardinal), we obtain that the fraction of subjects belonging to \\(A\\) or \\(B\\) is the sum of the fractions belonging to \\(A\\) and those belonging to \\(B\\).\n\nMore generally, if \\(A_1,A_2,\\ldots,A_n\\) are pairwise disjoint events, then \\[\nP(A_1\\cup A_2\\cup \\cdots \\cup A_n)=P(A_1)+P(A_2)+\\cdots +P(A_n).\n\\]\n\\(P(A-B)=P(A)-P(A\\cap B)\\).\n\\(P(A^c)=1-P(A)\\).\n\nThat is, the fraction of subjects that do not belong to \\(A\\) is 1 minus the fraction of those that do belong to \\(A\\).\n\nIf \\(A\\subseteq B\\), then \\(P(A)\\leqslant P(B)\\).\n\nIf \\(A\\) is contained in \\(B\\), the fraction of subjects belonging to \\(A\\) is less than or equal to the fraction of those belonging to \\(B\\).\n\n\\(P(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B)\\).\n\nIf you want to count how many subjects there are in \\(A\\cup B\\), you have to add those in \\(A\\) to those in \\(B-A\\). Dividing by the total population to convert to proportions, this tells us that \\[\nP(A\\cup B)=P(A)+P(B-A)=P(A)+P(B)-P(A \\cap B)\n\\] where the second equality is due to (5).\nFor example, if a population is 50% female and 60% nearsighted, and 35% of the total are nearsighted women, then the number of people who are either female or nearsighted (remember, or both) makes up 75% of the population. To the 50% of women, we must add the 25% of nearsighted people who are not women.\nThe number of subjects who belong to \\(A\\) but not to \\(B\\) is obtained by subtracting from the total number of subjects in \\(A\\) those who belong simultaneously to \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), that is, to \\(A\\cap B\\). Dividing by the total number of individuals in the population, we obtain the corresponding equality of proportions.\nExample:\n\nSuppose 0.1% of blood donors test positive for HIV, 1% test positive for herpes simplex virus (HSV), and 0.05% test positive for both tests.\nWhat is the probability that a randomly selected donor tests positive for at least one of the two tests? What is the probability that a randomly selected donor tests positive for HSV but not HIV?\nLet’s name the events involved in these questions:\n\n\\(A\\): Test positive for HIV. We know that \\(P(A)=0.001\\).\n\\(B\\): Test positive for HSV. We know that \\(P(B)=0.01\\).\n\\(A\\cap B\\): Test positive for both. We know that \\(P(A\\cap B)=0.0005\\).\n\\(A\\cup B\\): Test positive for at least one of the two. This is what we wanted to calculate in the first question.\n\nBy property (8): \\[\nP(A \\cup B) = P(A)+P(B)-P(A\\cap B)=0.001+0.01-0.0005=0.0105\n\\] The probability that a randomly selected donor will test positive for at least one of the two tests is 1.05%.\n\n\\(B-A\\): Test positive for HSV but not HIV. This is what we wanted to calculate in the second question.\n\nBy property (5), \\[\nP(B-A)=P(B)-P(A\\cap B)=0.01-0.0005=0.0095\n\\]\nThe probability that a randomly selected donor tests positive for HSV but not HIV is 0.95%.\n\nAnother way to calculate these probabilities without having to remember formulas would be:\n\nTake a population of a specific size as a reference.\nCalculate in this population how many individuals belong to \\(A\\cap B\\) (positive on both tests), how many to \\(A-B\\) (positive for HIV but not HSV), how many to \\(B-A\\) (positive for HSV but not HIV), and how many to \\(A^c\\cap B^c\\) (negative on both tests), and from there calculate whatever we want.\n\nThis method is often called the natural frequency method (“the old lady’s calculations” doesn’t sound scientific enough), and that’s what we’ll call it. Let’s put it into practice in our case:\n\nLet’s take a reference population of 10,000 donors.\n\nWhy this number? Let’s see, notice that the proportion of subjects in \\(A\\cap B\\) is 0.05%, or 0.0005. To make the calculations easier, we’d like all the numbers we get to be whole numbers, so as not to get confused with decimals. Since 0.0005 10000 = 5, it seems that 10,000 will work.\n\nThe subjects in \\(A\\) are 0.1% of the population: 10\nThe subjects in \\(B\\) are 1% of the population: 100\nThe subjects in \\(A\\cap B\\) are 0.05% of the population: 5\n\nIn summary: \\[\n\\begin{array}{r|c|c|c}\n& A\\ (\\text{HIV}+) & A^c \\ (\\text{HIV}-) & \\text{Total} \\\\ \\hline\nB\\ (\\text{HSV}+) & 5 & & 100 \\\\ \\hline\nB^c\\ (\\text{HSV}-) & & & 9900 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Total} & 10& 9990 & 10000 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\] 1. Then, the subjects in \\(A-B\\) will be those in \\(A\\) minus those in \\(A\\cap B\\): 5 1. And the subjects in \\(B-A\\) will be those in \\(B\\) minus those in \\(A\\cap B\\): 95 1. For now we have: 5 subjects positive for HIV and HSV; 5 positive for HIV and negative for HSV; and 95 positive for HSV and negative for HIV. In total, 105 subjects. The rest will be negative for both HIV and HSV.\nTherefore, the subjects in \\(A^c\\cap B^c\\) will be 10,000-105=9,895.\nWe obtain the following frequency table: \\[\n\\begin{array}{r|c|c|c}\n& A\\ (\\text{HIV}+) & A^c \\ (\\text{HIV}-) & \\text{Total} \\\\ \\hline\nB\\ (\\text{HSV}+) & 5 & 95 & 100 \\\\ \\hline\nB^c\\ (\\text{HSV}-) & 5 & 9895 & 9900 \\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Total} & 10& 9990 & 10000 \\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nAnd now, by changing “probability” to “proportion,” we can calculate whatever we want.\n\nWhat is the proportion of subjects who test positive for a given test?\n\nThere are 105 subjects in the table who test positive for some test: the 10 who are HIV positive and the 95 who are HSV positive and HIV negative. Therefore, their proportion is 105/10000 = 0.0105.\n\nWhat is the proportion of subjects who test positive for HSV but not HIV?\n\nThere are 95 subjects in the table who test positive for HSV and HIV negative, so their proportion is 95/10000 = 0.0095.",

For example, if the odds of failing a subject are 2/3, it means that:\nSince they are a quotient of two probabilities, the odds of an event are always greater than or equal to 0 and can take any value between 0 and \\(\\infty\\), inclusive.\nExercise If we roll a balanced 10-sided die numbered from 0 to 9:\nIf we know the odds of \\(A\\), we can calculate the probability \\(P(A)\\): \\[\n\\begin{array}{rl}\n\\text{Odds}(A)=\\dfrac{P(A)}{1-P(A)}\\!\\!\\!\\! & \\Longrightarrow \\text{Odds}(A)-\\text{Odds}(A)P(A)=P(A)\\\\\n& \\Longrightarrow P(A)=\\dfrac{\\text{Odds}(A)}{1+\\text{Odds}(A)}\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nTherefore, two events have the same probability if, and only if, they have the same odds.\nNote that the function \\[\nx\\mapsto\\frac{x}{1+x}\n\\] is increasing in \\(x\\):\nSince this is the function that transforms \\(\\text{Odds}(A)\\) into \\(P(A)\\), we deduce that \\[\n\\text{Odds}(A)&gt;\\text{Odds}(B)\\Longleftrightarrow P(A)&gt;P(B)\n\\]\nAs we will see, the correct way to present the results in case-control studies is in the form of odds ratios. The odds ratio of two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) is the quotient of their odds: \\[\n\\text{OR}(A,B)=\\frac{\\text{Odds}(A)}{\\text{Odds}(B)}\n\\] That is, \\(\\text{OR}(A,B)\\) tells us how many times greater (or less) the odds of \\(A\\) are than those of \\(B\\). Its value is difficult to interpret in terms of probabilities except for its relationship to 1:\nBut for example \\[\n\\text{OR}(A,B)=2 \\Longleftrightarrow \\text{Odds}(A)= 2\\cdot \\text{Odds}(B) \\hspace{1.2ex}\n\\not\\hspace{-1.2ex}\\Longleftrightarrow P(A)=\n2\\cdot P(B)\n\\]\nGiven two events \\(A\\) and \\(B\\), with \\(P(A)&gt;0\\), the probability of \\(B\\) conditioned on \\(A\\) is \\[\nP(B|A)=\\frac{P(A\\cap B)}{P(A)}\n\\]\nThis value represents the fraction of the subjects in \\(A\\) that belong to \\(B\\); that is, it is the probability that if \\(A\\) occurs, then \\(B\\) also occurs.\nExercise:\nAt a university, students are distributed as follows by type of study and gender: \\[\n\\begin{array}{r|c|c|c|c|c}\n\\text{Study} & \\text{Science} & \\text{Law} & \\text{Education} & \\text{Others} & \\text{Total}\\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Men} & 1200 & 1300 & 300 & 2000 & 4800\\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Women} & 1400 & 600 & 1600 & 1600 & 5200\\\\ \\hline\n\\text{Total} & 2600 & 1900 & 1900 & 3600 & 10000\\\\\n\\end{array}\n\\]\nIf I choose a student at random, what is the probability that:",

    "text": "9.1 Introduction\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate statistical method designed to transform a set of possibly correlated variables into a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) variables called principal components. Each principal component represents a linear combination of the original variables and is constructed in such a way that it captures as much of the total variance in the data as possible. The first principal component accounts for the maximum amount of variability, the second captures the next highest amount under the constraint of being orthogonal to the first, and so on.\nThe primary purpose of PCA is dimensionality reduction: by retaining only the first few components, one can approximate the original data while minimizing information loss. This facilitates visualization, pattern recognition, and noise reduction, especially in high-dimensional datasets where interpretation is otherwise difficult. The method assumes that the most meaningful structure of the data lies in the directions of greatest variance, thus replacing the original coordinate system with one defined by these new axes of variation.\nMathematically, PCA can be obtained through the eigendecomposition of the covariance or correlation matrix of the variables, or equivalently through singular value decomposition of the data matrix. The resulting eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each component, and the corresponding eigenvectors define the loadings that relate components to the original variables.

    "text": "10.1 Example\nPrincipal Component Analysis (PCA) is a multivariate statistical method designed to transform a set of possibly correlated variables into a new set of orthogonal (uncorrelated) variables called principal components. Each principal component represents a linear combination of the original variables and is constructed in such a way that it captures as much of the total variance in the data as possible. The first principal component accounts for the maximum amount of variability, the second captures the next highest amount under the constraint of being orthogonal to the first, and so on.\nThe primary purpose of PCA is dimensionality reduction: by retaining only the first few components, one can approximate the original data while minimizing information loss. This facilitates visualization, pattern recognition, and noise reduction, especially in high-dimensional datasets where interpretation is otherwise difficult. The method assumes that the most meaningful structure of the data lies in the directions of greatest variance, thus replacing the original coordinate system with one defined by these new axes of variation.\nMathematically, PCA can be obtained through the eigendecomposition of the covariance or correlation matrix of the variables, or equivalently through singular value decomposition of the data matrix. The resulting eigenvalues indicate the amount of variance explained by each component, and the corresponding eigenvectors define the loadings that relate components to the original variables. Interpreting PCA typically involves analyzing the loadings to understand which variables contribute most to each component, and the scores to explore how observations are positioned within the new reduced space.\nIn applied research, PCA serves as both an exploratory and a preprocessing tool. It reveals latent structures, mitigates multicollinearity, and prepares data for further modeling. As Jolliffe (2002) notes, PCA is not only a method of reduction but also a lens through which the essential geometry of multivariate data becomes interpretable.\nReference:\nJolliffe, I. T. (2002).

Without standardization, variables with large units (e.g., weight in grams) will dominate the principal components simply because of their scale. With scale(), each variable contributes according to its correlation, not its magnitude.",
