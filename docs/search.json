It concludes with practical guidance for setting up R and the course repository.\nNutrigenomics explores how dietary patterns influence gene expression, epigenetic marks, and metabolic outcomes. Statistically, we ask:\nMain challenges: high dimensionality (p‚â´n), correlated predictors, measurement error in diet data, and causal inference vs.¬†association.",
