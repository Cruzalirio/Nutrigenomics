    "section": "2.1 Basic Concepts",
    "text": "2.1 Basic Concepts\n\n2.1.1 Clinical Study\nA clinical study is a process whose objective is to obtain empirical evidence on a specific issue. In the case of the studies we are dealing with in this course, this issue is, naturally, about some aspect of nutrigenomics.\n\n\n2.1.2 Unit of Observation\nIn a statistical study, the unit of observation is, for the sake of clarity, the type of what or who is being measured during the research. In medical studies, these are typically people, but not always. For example, they can be events that happen to people, so that the same person can be observed multiple times: pregnancies, surgical operations. For example, we can measure the average daily expenditure on processed food vending machines in different primary schools in a city and the proportion of myopic students in their schools, to estimate whether there is any relationship between processed food consumption and myopia. Here, the unit of observation is the primary schools, not the students.\n\n\n2.1.3 Population and Sample\n\nPopulation: This is the set of all observation units about which we want to know some information. This population can be perfectly defined in a place and time: for example, those registered in Mallorca today. But its definition will usually be vague. If, for example, we want to estimate something about ‚Äúdiabetic Spaniards over 65 years of age,‚Äù who exactly are we talking about? Those who are alive right now? All those who have been in Spain since its founding? Do we include those who have not yet been born? What do we do with those who are diabetic but have not been diagnosed, and never will be?\nSample: This is a subset of the population that has been selected for observation. The idea is for the sample to be representative of the population, so that the results obtained from the sample can be generalized to the population. In the previous example, we could select a sample of diabetic Spaniards over the age of 65, and from this sample, attempt to estimate some characteristic of the diabetic population of Spaniards over the age of 65.\n\n\n\n2.1.4 Types of Statistics\nIn statistics, we always start by obtaining data on a sample of a population. Well, actually, we don‚Äôt start by obtaining the data, but by carefully planning how to obtain it.\nWe generalize the information obtained about this group of people to the entire population. And this isn‚Äôt just a case of fortune-telling magic tricks, but a science whose methodology has been validated through mathematical demonstrations or, in the worst case, through numerical simulations (the mathematical equivalent of experiments in other sciences).\nThus, the starting point when applying statistical techniques is that we have a set of data that describe some characteristics of a group of individuals. Statistical analysis of these data can then be of two basic types:\n\nExploratory data analysis, when our objective is simply to summarize, represent, and explain the specific data available. Descriptive statistics is the set of techniques used for this purpose.\nInferential analysis, if our objective is to deduce (infer) from these data, significant information about the entire population of interest. The techniques used in this case comprise inferential statistics.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.5 Why Design Matters\nDesign choice determines causal interpretability and power.\n\nCase‚Äìcontrol (retrospective): efficient for rare outcomes, common in gene‚Äìdiet interaction studies.\nExample: Hoang et al., JAMA Network Open (2024). DOI: 10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2024.0465\nCross-sectional: exposure and outcome measured simultaneously, used for exploratory omics‚Äìdiet associations.\nExample: Do et al., Int J Epidemiol. (2021). DOI: 10.1093/ije/dyaa215\nRandomized Controlled Trial (RCT): causal inference via randomization; typical for genotype‚Äëbased dietary advice.\nExample: Horne et al., BMC Public Health (2019). DOI: 10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8\n\nNote: Randomization removes confounding in expectation; observational designs require covariate adjustment and sensitivity analyses.",

    "text": "2.2 Design Types\n\n2.2.0.1 Descriptive Studies\n\nCase Report: A detailed description of a patient.\nCase Series: A detailed description of a small group of people with a common health problem. Information is usually collected through medical histories and clinical interviews.\nSurvey: A description of a large group of individuals with a common characteristic. Information is usually collected through questionnaires or interviews. These studies are used to identify interesting observations worthy of investigation.\n\n\n\n2.2.0.2 Case-Control Studies\n\nA group of individuals with the disease (cases) and a group of individuals without the disease (controls) are taken.\nThey are compared retrospectively to find differences in their past exposure to risk factors.\nIt is determined which risk factors were more common among cases than among controls.\nIt is inferred that, in the general population, exposure to these factors is associated with a higher likelihood of suffering from the disease.\n\nCase-control samples\n\nStratified sample: A sample made up of predetermined numbers of cases and controls. If the sample is stratified and artificially composed, we do not expect the proportion of cases in the sample to be representative of the population.\nCross-sectional samples: A sample with no restrictions on its composition, ‚Äúwhatever comes out.‚Äù If the sample is cross-sectional, we expect the proportion of cases in the sample to be representative of the population. Advantages of case-control samples:\nThe survey suffers from a lack of denominators: a control group with which to compare the cases.\nRelatively easy and quick to carry out, and therefore inexpensive.\nSuitable for studying rare, infrequent, or very short-term diseases.\nThey allow for studying the association between exposure to many risk factors and the disease in question.\n\nProblems: Biases\nBiases: Errors in the design or execution of a study that affect the data collected and may jeopardize the accuracy of the conclusions drawn from data collection through interviews/questionnaires.\n\nRecall bias: Everyone lies. Forgetfulness.\nDifferential recall bias: Cases and controls may recall relevant data differently.\nSurvivorship bias: Only ‚Äúliving‚Äù individuals are studied.\n\nProblems: Representativeness\nTo conclude that there is an association between exposure and disease, it would be necessary that:\n\nControls were similar to cases in all aspects except exposure.\nMatching: Select controls who are similar to cases in all relevant characteristics.\nControls were representative of the healthy population. Problems: Confounders\nConfounder: A characteristic associated with exposure that can cause disease. Disease\n\nProblems: Lack of Causality\nA case-control study cannot ‚Äúprove‚Äù that exposure to a risk ‚Äúcauses‚Äù a disease.\nIn reality:\n\nNo type of medical study can demonstrate with absolute certainty that exposure to a risk causes a disease.\n\n\n\n2.2.0.3 Cohort Studies\n\nA group of individuals are exposed to a risk factor and a group of individuals not exposed to the same risk factor.\nA group of individuals are exposed to a risk factor and a group of individuals not exposed to the same risk factor.\nThey are followed over a period of time to prospectively compare the occurrence of a disease in both groups.\nA study is made to determine whether the disease is more common among those exposed than among those not exposed.\nIf so, it can be inferred that, in the general population, exposure to the risk factor is associated with a higher likelihood of suffering from the disease.\nThe objective is to study the onset of the disease after exposure: The cohort must be composed of individuals without the disease at the time of follow-up.\n\nProspective versus Retrospective Cohort Studies\n\nProspective\n\n: Exposed and unexposed individuals are taken today, and their future outcomes are studied.\n\nRetrospective\n\n: Exposed and unexposed individuals are taken at a certain point in the past, and their outcomes to the present are studied.\n\n\n2.2.1 Statistical View of Each Design\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDesign\nDescription\nTypical Model\nKey Statistical Notes\n\n\n\n\nCase series\nDescriptive report of a group of individuals with a shared exposure, treatment, or outcome, without a control group.\nDescriptive or exploratory modeling\nLimited inferential power; often used for hypothesis generation.\n\n\nSurvey\nCross-sectional collection of information from a sample representing a population at one point in time.\nWeighted regression or complex survey design models\nIncorporate sampling weights and stratification; correct for design effects.\n\n\nCohort study\nObservational design following participants over time to assess associations between exposures and outcomes.\nCox proportional hazards or mixed models\nHandle time-to-event data; control for confounding and censoring.\n\n\nCase‚Äìcontrol study\nObservational design comparing subjects with an outcome (cases) to those without (controls).\nConditional logistic regression\nAdjust for matching, population structure, and selection bias.\n\n\nQuasi-experimental study\nDesign with an intervention but lacking random assignment, often using pre/post or matched control comparisons.\nDifference-in-differences, interrupted time series\nControl for confounding and temporal trends; weaker causal inference.\n\n\nExperimental (RCT)\nRandomized Controlled Trial assigning subjects randomly to treatments to infer causal effects.\nMixed models or ANCOVA\nPower analysis, ITT (intention-to-treat) principle; high internal validity.\n\n\nMeta-analysis\nStatistical synthesis of results from multiple independent studies addressing the same question.\nRandom- or fixed-effects models\nAssess heterogeneity (\\(I^2\\)); evaluate publication bias.\n\n\nSystematic review\nStructured, transparent literature review following predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria.\nNarrative synthesis or meta-analytic framework\nEnsures reproducibility and quality assessment of included studies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 Types of Data in Nutrigenomics\n\nOmics data (gene expression, methylation, metabolomics)\n\nExample: EWAS of diet quality ‚Äî DOI: 10.1093/ije/dyaa215\n\nClinical data (anthropometry, blood lipids, disease outcomes)\n\nExample: NOW Trial ‚Äî DOI: 10.1186/s12889-019-6621-8\n\nDietary data (FFQs, 24h recalls, dietary indices)\n\nExample: Zheng et al., PLOS ONE (2020).
