## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for the course Design of Experimental Studies and Applied Statistics in Nutrigenomics — part of the Master’s in Nutrigenomics program.

This repository contains all teaching materials, examples, datasets, and R scripts used throughout the course.  
The course is fully reproducible and designed to be explored as a Quarto Book published via **GitHub Pages**.

### 📘 Course Overview

This course introduces the statistical foundations of experimental design and applied data analysis in the context of nutrigenomics.  
Students will learn to manage, visualize, and analyze omics, clinical, and dietary data using **R** and reproducible workflows.

### Topics
1. **Introduction to Nutrigenomics** — study design and data types  
2. **Measures of Association**  
3. **Data Reading and Cleaning in R**  
4. **Multivariate Descriptive Statistics**  
5. **Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering**  
6. **Introduction to Systematic Reviews**

Each topic includes lectures, practical labs, and problem sets.


### Evaluation Criteria

The evaluation of the course Design of Experimental Studies and Applied Statistics in Nutrigenomics will be based on three main activities, each contributing to the final grade as described below.
